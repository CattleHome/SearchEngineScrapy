## Mac Setup Guide to Install Web Crawler
  
Note: All `grey highlighted` lines are terminal commands. You can do this in a single shell window.

### Before Setting Up crawler  

**Step 1:**  
_pip_ is required for the crawler.  
To Install _pip_,  
use Command:  
`sudo easy_install pip`  
(Type `pip --version` to see if it is installed correctly)  
  
  
### Setting up crawler  
1. Copy SearchEngineScrapy folder from location provided to you to any directory (Example: ~/Documents/)  
2. `cd SearchEngineScrapy`    
5. `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed`  (You need to re-run this command if this throws an error after accepting prompt to install xcode cmdline tools.)
  
  
### Running the Crawler  
1. Goto SearchEngineScrapy folder  (Example : `cd ~/Documents/SearchEngineScrapy/` : If it placed in Documents)     
  
_Run commands now to crawl the results:_  
Example (To crawl 5 pages of search results for PDFs with keyword 'Machine Learning', store URLs in output_filename.csv and download the files in the downloadFolder mentioned):  
   
To use Bing Search Engine:  
`scrapy crawl SearchEngineScrapy -a searchQuery="Machine Learning" -a fileType="pdf" -a searchEngine="bing" -a pages=5 -a downloadFolder="/Users/neyazee/Documents/SearchEngineScrapy/downloads/" -o output_filename.csv`    

(output_filename will contain URLs that are of filetype: pdf and query: 'Machine Learning' and all the files are downloaded to /Users/neyazee/Documents/SearchEngineScrapy/downloads/.)

### Downloading the crawled results

if _downloadFolder_ parameter is not specified, the files will not get downloaded and only the URLs are only crawled.
